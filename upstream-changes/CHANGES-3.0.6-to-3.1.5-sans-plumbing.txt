    ODBC-177 The fix and the testcase.
    
    In case of SP call, if one of its queries resulted in error, connector
    would not return the error on corresponding result fetch, but would
    return it as SQL_NO_DATA.
    Moreover, instead of last result with SP execution status, connector
    would also do the same. Thus, for example, application could not get
    affected rows count. That requires separate bug report, which I'll later
    add.
    Had to change some testcases, that did not expect last result with SP execution status, accordingly.

    ODBC-178 Optimization for some long queries
    
    Optimization only used for queries longer than 32K. And it skips most of
    parsing job in case if connector is sure that the query is not a multistatemnt and
    does not have parameters.

    ODBC-182 The fix and the testcase
    
    If parameter SQL_TIME field was bound as SQL_C_TIMESTAMP, and day field
    was not zero, the inserted time value would be different from the value
    in time fields of the parameter(server would add total number of hours in those days to the time). The patch makes connector to copy only time fields for the parameter.
    Also, the patch enforces time and date validity checks for such parameters, as the specs require.

    ODBC-169 The fix and the testcase.
    
    If data was fetched using SQLGetData, with batches of SELECTS that would fail like described int the bug - empty values or even crashes. The reason was that in such case one of structures involved in data fetching was not reset on move to the new resultset. That caused aforementioned errors.
    Also the patch fixes SQLRowsCount for batches of upserts or other
    statements generation affected rows count.
    Removed one unused funxtion, which also relied on C/C internals

    ODBC-186 The fix and testcases
    
    This is fixes several issues with SQLColumns and SQLProcedureColumns,
    as they share good part of SQL queries. Most of issues are rather minor.
    Here are their description from the JIRA.
    If SP parameter is described as double(m,n), connector will return its type as SQL_DOUBLE, and column size as m. While specs says that column size for SQL_DOUBLE is fixed and is 15.
    Connector should either return the type as SQL_DECIMAL, or return column size 15. The similar problem exists for float fields as well.
    BUFFER_LENGTH for decimal field does not consider if the field unsigned
    For SQLProcedureColumns NUM_PREC_RADIX is always 10, while it should be NULL for types, where it is not applicable, i.e. for non-numeric types
    BUFFER_LENGTH for character types contains incorrect data. Currently this is max number of bytes for encoding of string in charset used for storing data on server, while that has to be in the charset used for transferring data to the client.
    SQLColumns returns incorrect SQL_DATETIME_SUB - SQL_TYPE_DATE instead of SQL_CODE_DATE, etc. SQLProceduresColumns returns NULL for all data types, and also it returns incorrect inconcise type for datetime parameters - should be SQL_DATETIME for all date/time types
    Both functions would return NULL in COLUMN_SIZE, and would not return correct value in BUFFER_LENGTH for MySQL 'year' type
    SQLProcedureColumns should return empty string in COLUMN_NAME for procedure columns that does not have name, e.g. for functions's return value. It returns NULL instead
      Also both functions did not do difference between NULL and empty string parameters. Specs says, that "" has different meaning for catalog/schema name. Also CatalogName cannot be string search pattern, while it is allowed by connector.

    commented out.
    
    Also some possible issues are fixed along the way. Like caring of the
    case when value buffer is not provided for a field. Or using if

    Connector would not return NULL for 0000-00-00 datetime values in case
    of SQLGetData call, while doing that in SQLFetch.
    Also it would not do that ifn case of empty string conversion to
    date/time types.
    If time field fetched as timestamp type, fractional part was set to 0.
    
    The patch makes SQLFetch and SQLGetData to use the same function to copy
    data to application buffers and process erroneous values.

    ODBC-193 Enabling connect and most of operations
    
    SQLWCHAR encoding is depending on DM or on the size of SQLWCHAR. It's either utf16(UnixODBC) or utf32(iODBC). Since iconv needs to know if utf32 le or be, defining charset info struct for le order of bytes. More like a hack to make mariadb_coonvert_string to give iconv correct encoding name.
    Fixed failing testcase.

    ODBC-203 The fix and the testcase.
    
    The problem was occured only with data fetched as SQL_C_WCHAR. That
    happened because for statemnt handdles after 1st one there wasn't STMT_ATTR_UPDATE_MAX_LENGTH attribute set, and getting data as a widestring depends on max_length.
    Also changed similar ODBC-169 testcase to test data values, and not only
    column and row count.
    Added to test framework optional automatic unicode connection(with
    SQLDriverConnectW) and statement allocation in that connection.

    ODBC-216 The fix and the testcase.
    
    Connector returned wrong value for SQL_DESC_FIXED_PREC_SCALE. In the
    report it was going about bigint type, but in fact for more types
    SQL_TRUE was returned, where it shouldn't. At least in analogy with
    bigint. Moreover, since defininition of SQL_DESC_FIXED_PREC_SCALE is not
    super clear, I checked what SQL Server driver returns for different
    types. As MS's creation, I guess it can be used for reference if specs
    are ambigous. Only (small)money types SQL_TRUE is returned. MariaDB does not
    have it. And for types that has counerparts in MariaDB, SQL_FALSE is
    always returned. Thus, i made SQL_FALSE default value for all types for
    SQL_DESC_FIXED_PREC_SCALE field.

    ODBC-219 The fix and the testcase.
    
    The bug boils down to not reporting correct columns count in case of a query
    with multiple results(stored procedure or statements batch) if the result
    with affected rows count followed a resultset.
    In case of stored procedure(like in the bug report) this is always the case, if
    SP returns a result set.
    The bug occured becaule IRD was not reset in the SQLMoreResults in the
    described case.
    Fixed mistake in previous commit(for ODBC-216) - lost statement handler
    reinitialization in one place.
    Changed tests framework to print test result only after Stmt handler
    provided by framework to tests, reinitialized.

    ODBC-231 The fix and the testcase.
    
    The bug is rather in SSIS, I would say. It binds column size as signed
    int, but the value for LONGTEXT is max unsigned int. Connector was
    returning truncation error on the row fetch. And that is probably not
    quite right anyway, from everything I read is specs. Anyway, the patch
    makes connector not to return truncation error in case if truncation is
    caused solely by sign-ness of the field/buffer.

    columns metadata along with freen bind buffers. That it shouldn't do.

    ODBC-253 The fix and the testcase
    
    Added check that if length of the query is shorter, than mininmal
    possible length of a SQL statement, return syntax error right away.
    Fixed also local strndup version(for Windows) - it would not create copy
    of an empty string.
    Updated C/C to v3.0.10

    ODBC-254 INSTALL_LIB_SUFFIX is made CACHE, and made
    
    plugins to be installed under the same library. Also returned lib64 as
    libraries destination, if 64b library is built, and there is lib64 in
    the system. But that may be yet changed back.
    Returned plugins to the tarballs on linux. Probably was lost in a
    merge.

    ODBC-251 the testcase only + ODBC-210
    
    It's not quite clear if we should fix anything with 251, but adding the
    testcase to have it.
    Fixed rest of compilation warnings with iOdbc. At some point I've
    decided it's better to suppress the most common warnings in tests - in
    iOdbc SQLCHAR is unsigned char, and that caused tons of wranings
    Paramethrised some OSX packaging files along the way and fixed some
    cmake some found potential cmake issues.

    ODBC-257 and ODBC-258
    
    ODBC-257 copy/paste error in the cmake config
    ODBC-258 introduced INSTALL_DOC_DIR and INSTALL_LICENSE_DIR cmake
    parameters to make installation paths of docs and license file
    configurable. Also changed default subdirectoly name for those files from mariadb_connector_odbc to mariadb-connector-odbc

    ODBC-255 MSI upgrades DSN's to new driver version
    
    When driver is upgraded to a version from the new series, i.e. from 3.0
    to 3.1, DSN's using old version become unusable, since Driver name
    changes. Commit adds new small program, that is packaged in the MSI
    installer, and run after the installation process is complete to fix
    those "hanging" DSN's.

    ODBC-226 SQLMoreResults would not return error
    
    if batch was sent via text protocol, and a statement in the batch resulted in an error.
    Since MariaDB stops processing the batchin such case, specs say
    SQLMoreResults should return SQL_ERROR(otherwise should be
    SQL_SUCCESS_WITH INFO)
    Added OS X build on travis to "allow failures" section, while it's not
    clear how to fix it atm, and "manual" build works

    TLSPEERFPLIST, respectively. While leaved old names(SSLFP and SSLFPLIST) as aliases.
    Added input fields to the setup dialog on Windows.
    Previous commit missed memory freeing for the new field - added here.

    ODBC-87 Db combobox lost the selection after Test
    
    Connection test in the setup dialog triggers reading of the database(and charset) list, and populating of the combobox. But the current DB selection was not correctly restored after that.

    ODBC-264 Windows and OSX build fix.
    
    C/C is updated to 3.1.4
    For OSX added workaround for typo(aka bug) in c/c preventing linking of
    one of auth plugins. Plus solved some rather old issues in pkg cmake for
    the case, when src and build directories are different

    ODBC-196 Optimization for FORWARD_ONLY cursors
    
    in case of rows array fetch. Some optimization are done for other
    cursors as well - i.e. for static and dynamic. Especially if static
    navigated forward.
    Removed some workaround for the previous release build, and updated
    C/C sub-project.

    ODBC-267 Cleaned setup library build and linking
    
    Connection test now uses ODBC API, and not driver internals. Driver is
    not linked directly. Removed dependencies on the C/C as well DSN info from the dialog is passed to the
    connection API in the string, and not in the internal DSN structure.
    Added connection string to the connetion test result window.
